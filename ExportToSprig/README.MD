# How to use ExportToSprig

## Requirements

-   A 16x16 sprite
-   The sprite uses the sprig palette (`SprigPalette.aseprite`)

## Installation

Copy the `ExportToSprig.lua` to the aseprite script folder.  
The aseprite script folder can be opened through aseprite. To open it go to `File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder`

## Usage

Make sure that the image that you want to convert is currently the one viewed.  
If it is, go to `File > Scripts > ExportToSprig`.  
When you click it a console should open with the sprig bitmap.  
Press `Ctrl + C` to copy it and paste it between the `` bitmap` `` and the `` ` ``.

## Other

A test image is included with all the sprig colors and is named `colors.png`
